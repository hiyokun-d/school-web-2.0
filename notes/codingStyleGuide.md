# SMANSA Web Project Coding Style Guide

This coding style guide outlines the recommended conventions and guidelines for writing code in the SMANSA web project. Consistency in code style helps improve readability and maintainability of the project. Please follow these guidelines when contributing to the project.

## 1. Indentation and Formatting

- Use **4 spaces** for indentation. Avoid using tabs.
- Each line should not exceed **80 characters** for improved readability.

## 2. Naming Conventions

- Use **camelCase** for variable and function names. Example: `myVariable`, `myFunction`.
- Use **PascalCase** for class and component names. Example: `MyClass`, `MyComponent`.

## 3. Comments

- Include **meaningful comments** to explain complex logic or provide context when necessary.
- Comment your code in **English** for consistency and to facilitate collaboration.

## 4. File and Folder Structure

- Organize your files and folders in a **logical structure** that reflects the project's architecture and functionality.
- Use **kebab-case** for file and folder names. Example: `my-file.js`, `my-folder`.

## 5. HTML/CSS Guidelines

- Use **proper indentation** for HTML and CSS code.
- Separate CSS into **separate files** and link them in the HTML file for better maintainability.

## 6. JavaScript Guidelines

- Use **ES6 syntax** for writing JavaScript code.
- Declare variables using `let` or `const` instead of `var`.
- Use **descriptive variable names** that convey the purpose or meaning of the variable.
- Avoid using global variables whenever possible.
- Break complex logic into **modular functions** for improved reusability.

## 7. Git and Version Control

- Use **meaningful commit messages** that describe the changes made in the commit.
- Create a **new branch** for each feature or bug fix and merge it into the main branch after testing and code review.
- Pull the latest changes from the main branch before starting work on a new feature or bug fix.

## 8. Testing

- Write **unit tests** for critical functions or components to ensure their functionality and catch any potential regressions.

## 9. Documentation

- Document your code using **meaningful comments** to describe the purpose, input, and output of functions and components.

Following these coding style guidelines will help maintain a consistent and clean codebase for the SMANSA web project. Remember, readability and maintainability are key goals of the coding style guide.

Happy coding!
